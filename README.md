This project is to get comfortable using git and html. 
1. Set up a new repo on git - call it odin-recipes.
2. Clone it to my local machine (my computer)
3. cd into odin-recipes
4. set up README.md file in VS code by using code . in terminal

After completing this I will return to reflect on problems I ran into and how I over came them.

Completed project. Took approximately 2.5 hours.
Used some CSS to get more comfortable with layouts etc.
I learned a lot just doing this project compared to being in tutorial hell for the past few months. 
This was a lot of fun.
