            <li>Prepare the fajita veggies: To the same pan, add in the olive oil, peppers, onion, oregano, and salt. Saut√© for 5-6 minutes until softened and caramelized.</li>
            <li>Prepare the beans: Add the beans, chili powder, cumin, and lime juice to a saucepan over medium heat. Cook the beans for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and add salt if needed.</li>

            <li>Assemble the burritos: Place the tortillas between damp paper towels and microwave for 30 seconds to make them soft and pliable. Place each tortilla on large squares of tin foil. Place portions of the chicken, rice, veggies, beans, and any extra fixings in the middle of the tortilla.</li>
            <li>For each burrito, bring the bottom half of the tortilla up over the pile of fillings and tuck the bottom edge under the pile.
